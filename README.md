### Hi there, I'm Mija Wheeler
- I’m interested in marine conservation
- I’m currently learning about different careers in Marine Technology related to my major 
- I'm originally from Honolulu, Hawaii
- I'm a Junior in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I did robotics in high school and wanted to learn about electrical and programming. 
- A fun fact about me is:  that I got a license to scuba dive before I got my driver's license.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  Object-oriented programming in C
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Over the Range - It's a Disney movie that has evil yodeling and many Cow puns, so I think it's really fun.
